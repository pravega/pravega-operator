## Certificate Error: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook

While installing pravega, if we get the error as  below,
```
helm install pravega charts/pravega
Error: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "pravegawebhook.pravega.io": Post https://pravega-webhook-svc.default.svc:443/validate-pravega-pravega-io-v1beta1-pravegacluster?timeout=30s: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```
We need to ensure that certificates are installed before installing the operator. Please refer [prerequisite](../charts/pravega-operator/README.md#Prerequisites)

## Segment store in CrashLoopBackOff

If segmentstore goes in `CrashLoopBackOff` state while installing pravega and if segmentstore pod logs shows as below

```
2021-03-17 13:02:39,930 848  [main] ERROR o.a.b.client.BookieWatcherImpl - Failed to get bookie list :

        at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:510)
```
This issue is happening because name of the pravega cluster (which can be seen with the output of `kubectl get pravegacluster`) is not matching `PRAVEGA_CLUSTER_NAME` provided in the bookkeeper configmap. Due to that it is looking at a wrong path for ledger location in znode. In order to resolve this issue, we have ensure that the cluster name is same as that in [bookkeeper configmap](https://github.com/pravega/bookkeeper-operator/blob/master/deploy/config_map.yaml)

## Controller pod not in ready state

While installing pravega, if the controller pod goes in `0/1` state as below, it can be due to meta data mismatch in znode

```
pravega-pravega-controller-68d68796f4-m5w7m             0/1     Running            0          15m
```
To resolve this issue, we have to ensure that zookeeper, bookkeeper and longterm storage are recreated before doing the pravega installation.

## Unsupported Pravega cluster version

While installing pravega, if we get the below error
```
Error: admission webhook "pravegawebhook.pravega.io" denied the request: unsupported Pravega cluster version 0.10.0-2703.c9b7be114
```
We need to make sure the supported versions are present in config map by the following command

`kubectl describe cm supported-versions-map`

If the entries are not there in configmap, we have to add these options in the configmap by enabling test mode as follows while installing operator

```
helm install pravega-operator charts/pravega-operator --set testmode.enabled=true --set testmode.version="0.10.0"
```

Alternatively, we can edit the configmap and add entry as `0.10.0:0.10.0` in the configmap and restart the pravega-operator pod
## Unsupported upgrade from version

While upgrading pravega, if we get the error similar to below

```
Error from server (unsupported upgrade from version 0.8.0-2640.e4c436ba9 to 0.9.0-2752.2652549b3): error when applying patch
```
We need to make sure that supported versions are present in configmap as `0.8.0:0.9.0`. If the entries are missing, we have to add these options in the configmap by enabling test mode as follows while installing Operator

If the version from which we are triggering upgrade is present in configmap, use the below command.

```
helm install pravega-operator charts/pravega-operator --set testmode.enabled=true --set testmode.version="0.9.0"
```

If the version from which we are triggering upgrade and the version to which upgrade is performed are not present in configmap use the below command

```
helm install pravega-operator charts/pravega-operator --set testmode.enabled=true --set testmode.fromVersion="0.8.0" --set testmode.version="0.9.0"
```

Alternatively, we can edit the configmap and add entry as `0.8.0:0.8.0,0.9.0` in the configmap and restart the pravega-operator pod

## NFS volume mount failure: wrong fs type

If you experience `wrong fs type` issues when pods are trying to mount NFS volumes like in the `kubectl describe po/pravega-segmentstore-0` snippet below, make sure that all Kubernetes node have the `nfs-common` system package installed. You can just try to run the `mount.nfs` command to make sure NFS support is installed in your system.

In PKS, make sure to use [`v1.2.3`](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-2/release-notes.html#v1.2.3) or newer. Older versions of PKS won't have NFS support installed in Kubernetes nodes.

## Recover Statefulset when node fails

When a node failure happens, unlike Deployment Pod, the Statefulset Pod on that failed node will not be rescheduled to other available nodes automatically.
This is because Kubernetes guarantees at most once execution of a Statefulset. See the [design](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/pod-safety.md).

If the failed node is not coming back, the cluster admin can manually recover the lost pod of Statefulset.
To do that, the cluster admin can delete the failed node object in the apiserver by running
```
kubectl delete node <node name>
```
After the failed node is deleted from Kubernetes, the Statefulset pods on that node will be rescheduled to other available nodes.

## External-IP details truncated in older Kubectl Client Versions

When Pravega is deployed with `external-access enabled`, an External-IP is assigned to its controller and segment store services, which is used by clients to access it. The External-IP details can be viewed in the output of the `kubectl get svc`.
However, when using kubectl client version `v1.10.x` or lower, the External-IP for the controller and segment store services appears truncated in the output.

```
# kubectl get svc
NAME                                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                          AGE

```

This problem has however been solved in kubectl client version `v1.11.0` onwards.

```
# kubectl get svc

```

Also, while using kubectl client version `v1.10.x` or lower, the complete External-IP can still be viewed by doing a `kubectl describe svc` for the concerned service.

```
# kubectl describe svc pravega-pravega-controller

## Logs missing when Pravega upgrades

Users may find Pravega logs for old pods to be missing post upgrade. This is because the operator uses the Kubernetes
[rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#updating-statefulsets)
strategy to upgrade pod one at a time. This strategy will use a new replicaset for the update, it will kill one pod in the
old replicaset and start a pod in the new replicaset in the meantime. So after upgrading, users are actually using a new
replicaset, thus the logs for the old pod cannot be obtained using `kubectl logs`.

## Collecting logs for crashed pod

For collecting logs for crashed pod, use the below command

```
kubectl logs <podname> --previous
```

## Filtering kubectl Events

For filtering kubernetes events, please use the below command,

```
kubectl get events --namespace default --field-selector involvedObject.name=<name of the object> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

## Unrecognized VM option

While Installing pravega, if the pods didnt come up with error as below,

```
Unrecognized VM option 'PrintGCDateStamps'
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```
This is happening because some of default JVM options in operator is not supported by Java version used by pravega. This can be resolved by setting the JVM option `IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` as below.

```
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/pravega --version=[VERSION] --set zookeeperUri=[ZOOKEEPER_HOST] --set bookkeeperUri=[BOOKKEEPER_SVC] --set storage.longtermStorage.filesystem.pvc=[TIER2_NAME] --set 'controller.jvmOptions={-XX:+UseContainerSupport,-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions}' --set 'segmentStore.jvmOptions={-XX:+UseContainerSupport,-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions,-Xmx2g,-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=2g}'
```

## Operator pod in container creating state

while installing operator, if the operator pod goes in `ContainerCreating` state for long time, make sure certificates are installed correctly.Please refer [prerequisite](../charts/pravega-operator/README.md#Prerequisites)

## Recover Operator when node fails

If the Operator pod is deployed on the node that fails, the pod will be rescheduled to a healthy node. However, the Operator will
not function properly because it has a leader election locking mechanism. See [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.17.x/doc/proposals/leader-for-life.md).

To make it work, the cluster admin will need to delete the lock by running

```
kubectl delete configmap pravega-operator-lock
```
After that, the new Operator pod will become the leader. If the node comes up later, the extra Operator pod will
be deleted by Deployment controller.
