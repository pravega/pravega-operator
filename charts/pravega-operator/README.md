# Deploying Pravega-Operator

Here, we briefly describe how to install [pravega-operator](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-operator) that is used to create/configure/manage Pravega clusters atop Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
  - Kubernetes 1.15+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 3.2.1+
  - Cert-Manager v0.15.0+ or some other certificate management solution in order to manage the webhook service certificates. This can be easily deployed by referring to [this](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/)
  - An Issuer and a Certificate (either self-signed or CA signed) in the same namespace that the Pravega Operator will be installed (refer to [this certificate.yaml file](../../deploy/certificate.yaml) manifest to create a self-signed certificate in the default namespace)

## Installing Pravega-Operator

> Note: If you are running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), please [check this first](../../doc/development.md#installation-on-google-kubernetes-engine).

To install the pravega-operator chart, use the following commands:

```
$ helm repo add pravega https://charts.pravega.io
$ helm repo update
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/pravega-operator --version=[VERSION] --set webhookCert.certName=[CERT_NAME] --set webhookCert.secretName=[SECRET_NAME]
```
where:

- **[RELEASE_NAME]** is the release name for the pravega-operator chart.
- **[VERSION]** can be any stable release version for pravega-operator from 0.5.0 onwards.
- **[CERT_NAME]** is the name of the certificate created as a prerequisite
- **[SECRET_NAME]** is the name of the secret created by the above certificate

This command deploys a pravega-operator on the Kubernetes cluster in its default configuration. The [configuration](#operator-configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

>Note: If we provide [RELEASE_NAME] same as chart name, deployment name will be same as release-name. But if we are providing a different name for release(other than pravega-operator in this case), deployment name will be [RELEASE_NAME]-[chart-name]. However, deployment name can be overridden by providing --set  fullnameOverride=[DEPLOYMENT_NAME]` along with helm install command

>Note: If the pravega-operator version is 0.4.5, webhookCert.certName and webhookCert.secretName should not be set. Also in this case, bookkeeper operator, cert-manager and the certificate/issuer do not need to be deployed as prerequisites.

## Upgrading Pravega-Operator

For upgrading pravega-operator, please refer [upgrade guide](../../doc/operator-upgrade.md)

## Uninstalling Pravega-Operator

To uninstall/delete the pravega-operator chart, use the following command:

```
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
